        <h1>GCSE vs A-Level: What Changes?</h1>
        <p class="blog-intro">
          Understand the key differences between GCSEs and A-Levels ‚Äî and how to
          adapt to succeed in the next stage of your academic journey.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Depth Over Breadth</h2>
        <p>
          GCSEs cover a wide range of subjects, often 8‚Äì10 or more. A-Levels
          narrow this to just 3 or 4 subjects, but with **much greater depth and
          complexity**. You‚Äôre expected to master content at a much higher
          level.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Independent Learning</h2>
        <p>
          At A-Level, teachers provide less step-by-step guidance. You're
          expected to take more **responsibility for reading, revision, and time
          management**. Building strong study habits is essential.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Increased Workload</h2>
        <p>
          A-Level students often report a significant **jump in workload** ‚Äî not
          just more content, but also more critical thinking, essay writing, and
          exam technique. Planning ahead is key.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Exam Style and Difficulty</h2>
        <p>
          GCSEs test foundational knowledge, often with direct questions.
          A-Levels require **analysis, evaluation, and application** of
          knowledge in new contexts. Past paper practice becomes more important.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Impact on University & Career</h2>
        <p>
          Your A-Level grades directly influence your university offers or
          career opportunities. Choosing subjects you enjoy ‚Äî and that align
          with future goals ‚Äî will help you stay motivated.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Adapting Successfully</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose subjects that match your strengths and interests</li>
          <li>Develop independent study routines early on</li>
          <li>Use planners, flashcards, and spaced repetition tools</li>
          <li>Ask for help when needed ‚Äî don't fall behind</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="blog-summary">
          Transitioning from GCSEs to A-Levels can be a challenge, but with the
          right mindset and tools, it becomes an opportunity to grow
          academically and personally.
