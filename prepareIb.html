        <h2>1. Understand the IB Exam Format</h2>
        <p>
          Start by reviewing your subject-specific exam structure, paper format,
          and command terms. Understanding how you're assessed gives your
          revision a clear direction.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Build a Realistic Study Timetable</h2>
        <p>
          Use tools like Google Calendar or Notion to block time for subjects
          based on difficulty. Follow the 50/10 method ‚Äî 50 minutes study,
          10-minute break. Always schedule review days and buffer time.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Use IB Past Papers & Mark Schemes</h2>
        <p>
          Practice with real exam papers to get familiar with question formats
          and time pressure. Use official mark schemes to self-assess and
          identify gaps.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Active Recall & Spaced Repetition</h2>
        <p>
          Replace passive reading with active recall using flashcards (Anki,
          Quizlet), quizzes, and peer teaching. Space out topics over time for
          better long-term retention.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Focus on IA and TOK Early</h2>
        <p>
          Your IA and TOK essay contribute to final scores. Begin early, follow
          structure, and get regular feedback from your teacher or tutor. Treat
          them as priority tasks, not add-ons.
        </p>

        
        <h2>6. Don‚Äôt Ignore Health</h2>
        <p>
          Good sleep, regular meals, and short physical breaks can drastically
          improve memory and performance. Aim for balance, not burnout.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-summary">
          The IB rewards consistent effort, not cramming. Stay on schedule,
          practice smart, and reach out if you need help.
